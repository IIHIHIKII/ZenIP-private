# ZenIPs

Horizen Improvement Proposals for the [Horizen Ecosystem](https://www.horizen.global).
Participation in the Horizen project is subject to a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ZencashOfficial/zenips/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).

## Motivation

Protocol Improvement Proposals are an established mechanism to decide upon new features and core protocol changes in many blockchain projects.
We believe that it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel so we will adopt our own version of an improvement proposal system — the Horizen Improvement Proposal System - short ZenIP.
ZenIPs are meant to standardize the process of suggesting major changes to the Horizen code base and processes.

## Specification

A ZenIP in and of itself is a document that describes a new feature. It explains the rationale behind the proposed feature and elaborates on why certain design decisions were made.

We are fairly liberal with approving ZenIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.
Having a ZenIP in this repository does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

The full specification of the ZenIP process can be found in [ZenIP-42000](https://github.com/ZencashOfficial/zenips/blob/master/zenip-42000.md).
